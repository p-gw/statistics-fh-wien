# Descriptive Statistics & Visualization

Describing data is always an important step during an emprical research project or data analysis in general. 
There are a lot of different ways to carry out this task, but both **numerical** and **visual** data description of some sort are employed almost every time.

In this lecture we will first discuss numerical statistics to describe quantitative data. We will subsequently look at some of the most common statistical visualization types and learn when to use them.

## Descriptive statistics
Descriptive measures can be categorized in various ways. Most commonly they are grouped by the *number of variables* they consider. If a descriptive measure summarizes one variable we call them **univariate** descriptive statistics. If they summarize two variables, we label them as **bivariate** descriptive statistics. Generally statistics which consider more than two variables are called **multivariate** statistics.
	
Lets start with an example: In the student questionnaire at the beginning of the semester I asked you to provide both your *height* and the *handspan* of your dominant hand. 

As you can see, just looking at the raw data for our heights does not give us very much information.

### Univariate descriptive statistics
Both descriptive statistics in the example were *univariate*, but did differ significantly in their interpretation. The average is concerned with finding a **representative value** for the sample, the extent (minimum and maximum) were a attempt to summarize how **different** the values in the sample are.

This theme arises all over statistics and we can group descripitve statistics accordingly. We call descriptive statistics which try to find a representative value *measures of central tendency* and statistics which try to summarize the spread of the data *measures of variability*.

In this section we will get to know some of the most common univariate statistics and see when and for which type of variable they are appropriate.

#### Measures of central tendency
##### Mean
The *sample mean* or *arithmetic mean* of a sample $x_1, \ldots, x_N$ is defined by

$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i,$

where $N$ is the sample size. To calculate the sample mean we must first add up all the samples and then divide by the number of samples. 
The result we get is an *average* data point.

Consider the sample $x_1 = 1.5$, $x_2 = 4.0$ and $x_3 = 5.4$. If we calculate the sum we get 

$\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1.5 + 4.0 + 5.4 = 10.9.$

Then we must divide by the number of data points ($N = 3$ in the example) to get the sample mean of $\bar{x} = 10.9/3 \approx 3.63$.

We can verify this result in software:

The sample mean is probably the most important measure of central tendency. But when is it applicable? In general it is appropriate for all *quantitative* variables (interval and ratio scale), but as we will see later it might not be the best choice for some sample distributions.

A notable exception to this is binary data. In the student questionnaire we also collected *Gender*. Not including the category *prefer not to say* this is a nominal binary variable with the respective values *male* and *female*. If we code our nominal variable with 

$x_i = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if gender is female,}\\

In practical application the arithmetic mean is used *everywhere*. We will see some examples of this later in the course, for example when the arithmetic mean is used to estimate expected values from probability distributions. 

###### Practical application: COVID-19 cases in Austria
But for now let us consider a practical example in time series analysis, the **simple moving average**. As an example we will use the time series of daily COVID-19 cases in Austria. From the following plot it is obvious there is a clear 'trend', but there is also a lot of variability from day to day (zig-zag-line). The moving average can help us to better visualize the trend in the data.

The moving average is what is typically displayed in news reports, see e.g. [here](https://at.staticfiles.at/snippets/interaktiv/2020/03-covid19/neuinfektionen.html?599c7e4cbe44eac594e3).

Calculation of the moving average is identical to the simple arithmetic mean with one exception. Instead of calculating the mean over the whole sample, we define some time frame (the so called window length) and calculate the mean for every subseqent time. Consider the following toy example with 7 measurements of stress level (0 - 100) during the week:

| day | t | stress level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | 1 | 53 |
| Tuesday | 2 | 77 |

To calculate the moving average we first must define the window length to know how many values to use for each mean. Let us set a window length of 3, such that for each day we take the previous, current, and upcoming day into account.

Monday: There is no previous day, so no moving average can be calculated.

Tuesday: $\bar{x}_2 = \frac{1}{3}(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = \frac{1}{3}(53 + 77 + 68) = 66$

Wednesday: $\bar{x}_3 = \frac{1}{3}(x_2 + x_3 + x_4) = \frac{1}{3}(77 + 68 + 61) \approx 68.6$

Thursday: $\bar{x}_4 = \frac{1}{3}(x_3 + x_4 + x_5) = \frac{1}{3}(68 + 61 + 39) = 56$

Friday: $\bar{x}_5 = \frac{1}{3}(x_4 + x_5 + x_6) = \frac{1}{3}(61 + 39 + 21) \approx 40.3$

Saturday: $\bar{x}_6 = \frac{1}{3}(x_5 + x_6 + x_7) = \frac{1}{3}(39 + 21 + 19) = 79$

##### Median
Sometimes the arithmetic mean is not a very good representation of a *typical* value. We can see this in many examples, but a common one is the income distribution in the general population. Income distributions are typically not very *symmetric*, but skewed. There are a lot of people with low and medium incomes and a disproportionate number of people with very high incomes.

As an alternative we can use the **median**, which is defined as the value seperating the lower and upper half of the sorted data. Calculating the median requires multiple steps:

1. Order the data from smallest value to greatest value,
2. Calculate the median from the ordered list  
    - If the number of elements in the ordered list is *odd*, take the middle value
    - If the number of elements in the ordered list is *even*, calculate the mean of the two values in the middle
    
Formally we can write the formula for the median as

$\text{median}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x_{\lfloor\frac{n}{2} + 1\rfloor} + x_{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}).$

 $\lfloor \ldots \rfloor$ and $\lceil \ldots \rceil$ describe the [floor and ceiling functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions). The floor function rounds down to the nearest integer while the ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer.

We can again take a look at the stress level example to calculate the median stress level during the week.

First we sort the data in ascending order.

	19, 21, 39, 53, 61, 68, 77

Since the number of data points is odd, we can just take the middle value of the ordered list. The resulting median is $x_4 = 53$.

Alternatively we can use the mathematical formula to calculate the median.
To do this we first get the appropriate indizes for the $x$ values, $\frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{7 + 1}{2} = 4$. It follows that $\lfloor 4 \rfloor = \lceil 4 \rceil = 4$. So the resulting median is,

$\text{median}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x_4 + x_4) = \frac{1}{2}2x_4 = x_4 = 53.$

We can verify this result in software:
"""

Since we now know how the median is calculated, we can see how it is different from the arithmetic mean. It **does not** take into account the numerical distance of the data points, but only their ordering. This has the conseqence that

1. The median is more *robust*, meaning that *outliers* do not have a large influence on the result,
2. It is appropriate for **ordinal data**.

###### Practical example: Calculating average grades

Often you will see people calculate the arithmetic mean of grades. With the information we have so far we know that this is generally not appropriate. Take for example the grading scheme of this course:

	90 < very good (1) <= 100
	75 < good (2) <= 90
	60 < satisfactory (3) <= 75
	50 < sufficient (4) <= 60
	0 < insufficient (5) <= 50

It is easy to see that some grade categories have a much wider range than others, so we should not simply calulate the mean of grades. Instead we notice that grades are obviosly ordered, from best to worst, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

##### Quantiles
The median is actually a special case of a more general concept called *quantiles*. While the median splits the data in 2 equally sized parts, the number of splits is arbitrarily large when calculating quantiles. We call a $p$-quantile a quantile a fraction $p$ of the data values are below the quantile and a fraction $(1 - p)$ of the data is above the quantile. The calculation of a $p$-quantile is almost exactly the same as for the median, but requires different indizes for the data values.

To calculate the $k$-th $q$-quantile we can apply the following formula[^1],

$\mathrm{quantile}_p(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x_{\lfloor np + 1\rfloor} + x_{\lceil np \rceil}).$

If we choose $p = \frac{1}{2}$ we can see that the formula is identical to the formula for the median,

$\textrm{quantile}_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(x_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} + 1\rfloor} + x_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}) = \mathrm{median}(x).$

There are other are types of quantiles which are often used in statistics and thus have a special name. The most common ones are **quartiles** and **percentiles**.

**Quartiles**

Quartiles arise when we partition the data in four equally sized groups. The three cutpoints between the groups correspond exactly to the 0.25-quantile, 0.50-quantile and 0.75-quantile in the data. 

| p | quantile | name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.25 | 0.25-quantile | lower quartile, first quartile |
| 0.50 | 0.50-quantile | median, second quartile |
| 0.75 | 0.75-quantile | upper quartile, third quartile |

Quartiles are used often when summarizing data or in visualizations (e.g. Boxplots). 

**Percentiles**

Similarly the data can be split into 100 groups equally sized groups. The resulting 99 cutpoints are then called percentiles. Accordingly the 33th-percentile would refer to the value of the data where 33% of the values are lower and 77% of the values are higher than the value in question. 

> 50th-percentile, second quartile, and median all refer to the same quantity!

##### Mode
Another popular choice to describe a representative value of a dataset is the *sample mode*. It is the value of the sample which **appears most often**. For discrete data (e.g. student grades) we can find the mode by just counting the number of appearances and choosing the value which appears most often. 

If we take a look at the sample $x = [1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ of student grades and their associated number of occurances,

| value | count |
| --- | --- |

Since the mode does not use numerical information of the data, it is appropriate for *all types of data*, even nominal variables.

Note that for samples of continuous data the mode is not very useful, because the values will be generally *unique* (the number of occurances for each data point will be one). In practice one often bins the data to make them discrete and calculate the mode of the discretized sample data. We will see an example of this later when we take a look at the histogram.

In contrast to the mean and median, the mode is not always unique. Consider the data $x = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]$. Calculating the number of appearances here reveals that both 0 and 1 appear 5 times. We can then say that both 0 and 1 are modes. We call this type of data **bimodal**. If there exist more than 2 modes the data can be considered **multimodal**.

##### Comparing mean, median, and mode
We have already seen that different measures of central tendency are appropriate for different data types. An important consideration when calculating summary statistics is also the **robustness** of the statistic. Robustness refers to the effect that some influential observations, so called **outliers**, can have on the value of a statistic. If outliers do not change the value of of the statistic much we call the statistic *robust*.

As can be seen in the following example, the median and mode are both more robust to outliers than the arithmetic mean.

**A note on measurement units**

At a first glance it is not really clear what the results for the variance mean and how to interpret them. The reason is that the unit of measurement is the square of the original unit itself. If we we have a data set with height measurements in `cm`, the variance of the measurements are in `cm²`. Similarly, the units of measurement for the variance of `stress level` is `(stress level)²` - not very intuitive.

To make the dispersion of the data more interpretable, we transform the variance back to the original measurement unit by taking the square root,

The result $s$ is called the sample **standard deviation**. Since it is on the same measurement scale as the original data it has a natural interpretation: It is the *average distance* of all data points from the mean. Just like the variance a low standard deviation indicates low dispersion, and a high standard deviation indicates high dispersion in the data.

##### Range
Another way to summarize the dispersion in the data is to calulate the *range*. The range is just the difference between the highest and the lowest value in the data. 

$\mathrm{range}(x) = \mathrm{maximum}(x) - \mathrm{minimum}(x)$

The range does not carry as much information as variances or the interquartile range and is therefore seldom used on its own. Calculating the range can be useful if we do not have a lot of data or in addition to other measures of dispersion. Because the range only does take into account two values (the minimum and the maximum) in the data, it is **highly sensitive to outliers**. 

Consider a datasset of daily steps, $x = [6618, 6981, 7073, 6799, 6901]$. Here the range would be $\mathrm{range}(x) = 7073 - 6618 = 455$. If we ran a half-marathon the next day we would observe a step count of $x_6 = 29813$. Then the calculated range of the data is $(29813 - 6618)!

### Bivariate descriptive statistics


#### Contingency tables
A *contingency table* or *cross tabulation* is a statistical method to display the **frequency distribution** of two (or more) variables. Contingency tables contain the count of each variable combination as well as the marginal sums, and total sum. 

As an example we can look at a 2x2 contingency table of the variables $a$ and $b$: 

| a \ b | b1 | b2 | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **a1** 	 | $n_{11}$ | $n_{12}$ | $n_{1.}$ |
| **a2** | $n_{21}$ | $n_{22}$ | $n_{2.}$ |
| **total**	 | $n_{.1}$ | $n_{.2}$ | $n_{..}$ |

The cell frequencies $n_{ij}$ refer to the frequency of the variable combination $a = i$ and $b = j$. To get the marginal frequencies $n_{.j}$ or $n_{i.}$, which reflect the count of $a = i$ over all categories of $b$ or the count of $b = j$ over all categories of $a$, we can sum the elements in each row or column. 

For examplewe can calculate the marginal sum of **a2**: $n_{2.} = \sum_{i=1}^2 n_{2i} = n_{21} + n_{22}$. 
"""

# ╔═╡ 6d94738a-0bc6-11eb-1d20-ad56eeb7c69c
md"""
Often it can be helpful to not display the counts, but the relative frequency of the category combinations. The relative frequency of a cell can be calculated by dividing the count by the total count,

$r_{ij} = \frac{n_{ij}}{n_{..}}.$

In the example below we can see the contingency table for the variables *sex* and *handedness* for a hypothetical sample of $n_{..} = 100$ persons. 

| sex \ handedness | right-handed | left-handed | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **male** 	 | 43 | 9 | 52 |
| **female** | 44 | 4 | 48 |
| **total**	 | 87 | 13 | 100 |

As can be seen, the marginal sums are just calculated by summing up each row or column of the table respectively. To get a contingency table with relative frequencies we just divide every entry in the table by the grand total.

| sex \ handedness | right-handed | left-handed | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **male** 	 | 0.43 | 0.09 | 0.52 |
| **female** | 0.44 | 0.04 | 0.48 |
| **total**	 | 0.87 | 0.13 | 1.00 |


In spreadsheet software contingency tables are sometimes called **pivot tables**.

## Visualization

Vizualisation of data, descriptive statistics and statistical models is a vital part in the statistical workflow. Graphs can provide you with information which remain hidden when just calculating summary statistics. Often you will find that graphs reveal outliers or implausible values.  

While graphs are essential when exploring the data before or during statistical analysis, they can also be used to great effect in the communication of results. We will see in the next section different types of statistical graphs as well as vizualisation techniques and see when it is appropriate to use them.

In modern news reporting the use of graphics is also heavily emphasized. These types of vizualisations do not necessarily follow the guidelines provided here, but are sometimes effectively employed for communication. You can find examples of these so called *infographics* on the website of [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph).

### Univariate vizualisations
Which type of vizualisation you use for a single variable can depend on the scale of the variable itself. For quantitative variables 

###### Histograms
Histograms are appropriate to visualize a quantitative variable (interval or ratio scale). Histograms are used to (approximately) represent the distribution of the variable by discretizing or **binning** the data. Binning refers to the grouping of the variable in consecutive and non-overlapping intervals. The choice of size and number of bins are up to the researcher. 

Typically, we construct *bins of equal width* and count the number of values within each interval.

# ╔═╡ 83a82e56-0a30-11eb-1a37-0558a2b1ff03

When using unequal bin sizes, the *area of the bin* is proportional to the number of cases. The height of each bin is then calculated by weighting the count $n_i$ in an interval by the bin width, 

$\mathrm{binheight}_i = \frac{\mathrm{minimum}(\mathrm{binwidth})}{\mathrm{binwidth}_i} \cdot n_i$

In the example above the adjusted bin widths are, 

| interval | count | bin width | bin height |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [164, 169] | 22 | 6 | 7.33 |
| [170, 171] | 27 | 2 | 27 |

###### Boxplots

Another way to visualize the distribution of a quantitative variable is the *boxplot*. Instead of plotting the grouped raw data, the boxplot makes use of descriptive statistics based on ordinal data. It displays the quartiles (lower quartile, median, and upper quartile) as the box. The so called *whiskers* extend beyond the box on both ends to the minimum and maximum values in the data. If there are values lower or higher than ±1.5 times the interquartile range in the data, the whiskers extend to this range and more extreme points are classified as outliers.  

![](https://lsc.studysixsigma.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/12/1435.png)

The boxplot, just like the histogram, can give us information about the shape of a distribution. 

A more modern variant of the boxplot is the **violin plot**. Instead of displaying summary statistics, which can hide information in the data, the violin plot shows the whole distribution by a procedure called *kernel density estimation*.

Plot type: $(@bind box_or_violin Select(["box" => "boxplot", "violin" => "violin plot"]))

###### Pie charts

It is generally recognized that the human perception is more accurate for lengths than it is for angles, making bar charts easier to interpret than pie charts. This is not necessarily an issue if the number of categories is small, but becomes clearly apparent for a larger number of categories.

### General design principles
Creating good graphics requires a lot of thought. Not only do you have to think about which type of visualization is appropriate for your application, but also about graphical design. While guidelines for graphical design (such as this) are often highly opinionated, they can still give you valuable information.

###### Color 
The choice of colors in your graphics is a very important one. Good color design can make your graph more appealing to look at and attract attention of the viewer. 

On the most basic level you have to consider your color palette. There are three types of palettes available: *sequential*, *diverging* and *qualitative*.

About 5% of the general population have some form of **colorblindness**.  The most common form is *red-green colorblindness*, which affects approxmately 8% of males and 0.4% of females. Accordingly, one has to take care to avoid ambiguity of the graphic when it is viewed by a person affected by colorblindness. Although there exist many colorblindness friendly color palettes, a lot of software still defaults to unsave color scales. A very common example for this is the *jet* color scale often used in heatmaps. Jet is a qualitative continuous color palette with blue, green, yellow and red which makes it very difficult for people with colorblindness to distinguish between the associated variable values.

#### Measures of variability
As data summaries measures of central tendency are immensly helpful, but do not give us the full picture. While clearly different, the following datasets have approximately the same mean and median. 

dataset 1: mean = $(round(mean(samp1), digits = 2)), median = $(round(median(samp1), digits = 2))

dataset 2: mean = $(round(mean(samp2), digits = 2)), median = $(round(median(samp2), digits = 2))
