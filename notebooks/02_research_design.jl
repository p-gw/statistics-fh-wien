# Principles of quantitative research

In this lecture we will cover the basic principles of quantitative research, what are the typical steps in conducting quantitative research, and introduce basic concepts of measurement and data collection. 

The overarching questions we seek to answer are,

1. In which ways can we conduct quantitative empirical research?
2. What is measurement? 
3. How can we construct appropriate measurement instruments?
4. What are typical approaches to data collection?

## Introduction to quantitative research
### Controlled experiments

> [An experiment is] a series of observations conducted under **controlled conditions** to study a relationship with the purpose of drawing **causal inferences** about that relationship. An experiment involves the **manipulation** of an independent variable, the **measurement** of a dependent variable, and the exposure of various participants to one or more of the conditions being studied. Random selection of participants and their **random assignment** to conditions also are necessary in experiments.

-- APA Dictionary of Psychology [üåê](https://dictionary.apa.org/experiment)

From the definition it becomes clear that the definining characteristics of an experiment are

1. the experimental manipulation, 
2. random assignment to the experimental or control conditions,
3. control of experimental conditions.

The goal of a controlled experiment is to isolate a **treatment effect**. The treatment effect is a *causal effect* of one variable (the treatment exposure) on an observed outcome. The way to achieve this is the random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups. It guarantees us (probabilistically) that the groups *do not differ systematically* and other variables (*covariates*) do not influence the exposure to treatment. 

Visually, we can represent controlled experiments like this:

md"""
If a controlled experiment is carried out correctly, it can give us strong evidence about the treatment effect in question -- it has high **internal validity**. However, when applied in the social sciences controlled experiments can sometimes generalize poorly to the real world (low **external validity**), because in practice treatment effects can be variable and influenced by a lot of additional factors that cannot be controlled for.

md"""
Let us take a look at the most well known example of a controlled experiment.

**Example:** Testing of drug efficacy

In clinical research efficacy of a drug is tested only after the safety has been established. Testing of drug efficacy is usually designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In these trials, patients are assigned to treatment or control conditions at random. The treatment assignment is in many cases **double-blind**, i.e. neither participant nor investigator know whether the participant is in the control or experimental condition. Another possibility is to carry out a **blind** study, where only the participant is unaware of the experimental group they are in. The difference is that a double-blinded study can rule out **experimenter bias**, while a blinded study can not. 

Once the random assignment is completed and the trial is run, one compares the groups with respect to some predefined outcome measure (e.g. tumor size for cancer drugs). If the analysis shows that the outcome measure is different between groups (smaller tumor size in experimental group compared to control) the drug can be declared effective. 

Choice of control conditions are very important, especially in clinical trials. One typically does not compare *treatment vs. no treatment*, but *treatment vs. placebo* or *new treatment vs. established treatment*. Comparing the treatment group to a placebo group is preferable since it is known that even inert treatments (placebos) can have a therapeutic effect (**placebo effect**). In clinical research it is often not possible to compare a treatment to a placebo due to ethical concerns, since this would mean denying treatment to patients. Another possibility is to compare different treatments and declare the trial a success if the new treatment is an improvement over the established treatment options.

### Natural experiments

> [A natural experiment is] the study of a naturally occurring situation as it unfolds in the real world. [...] The researcher **does not exert any influence** over the situation but rather simply observes individuals and circumstances, **comparing the current condition to some other condition**. 

-- APA Dictionary of Psychology [üåê](https://dictionary.apa.org/natural-experiment)

A natural experiment is similar to a controlled experiment, but with a crucial difference: The assignment to the experimental conditions is *not random* but occurs through some known mechanism such that treatment and control groups do not differ systematically. Thus, the treatment exposure is provided to us naturally through this process. Natural experiments also allow for the investigation of causal treatment effects. They are often used if it is not feasible or ethical to carry out a controlled experiment.

The stylized graph of a natural experiment matches exactly that of a randomized controlled trial (see above).

During the outbreak it was observed that the death rate in specific areas in the city were very different and that the death rate was highly associated with the water source of an area. The investigators discovered that areas which recieved water from the Thames downstream from a sewage plant had much higher death rates than areas which recieved water upstream from the plant.

In this example the treatment assignment is nonrandom and people were assigned to "treatment" (sewage water) or control group (clean water) based on where they received their water supply from. Since people in different areas did not differ systematically in ways other than their water supply, one can infer the causal effect of the treatment. The investigator came to the conclusion that impure water causes cholera and higher death rates, thus providing strong evidence for the germ theory of disease transmission for the disease.

### Observational studies

> [An observational study is] research in which the experimenter **passively observes** the behavior of the participants without any attempt at intervention or manipulation of the behaviors being observed. Such studies typically involve observation of cases under **naturalistic conditions** rather than the random assignment of cases to experimental conditions [...].

Observational studies differ from controlled and natural experiments in that there is no manipulation of the treatment exposure, either through randomization or known process. Instead, the researcher in an observational study simply observes the subjects of the study *without an intervention*. 

It can be seen from the graph below, that there is no treatment assignment in an observational study. Both treatment exposure and the outcome can be influenced by covariates. If this is the case, the covariate is called a **confounder** and causes **spurious associations** between treatment exposure and the outcome. A spurious association arises when two variables are associated, but not causally related.

**Example:** Evaluation of an academic support program

Suppose we want to investigate the effectiveness of an existing educational support program. The goal of this program is to close the gap in achievement between children with low and high socioeconomic background. For this reason the program is aimed at children with low socioeconomic background, who get additional remedial lessons. Through this program children are exposed to treatment (remedial lessons) if they are considered low socioeconomic status and control otherwise. Note that there is no intervention by the researcher and the resulting groups differ systematically in their socioeconomic status.

When evaluating this program one has to take precautions because the covariate (socioeconomic status) influences *both* treatment exposure and outcome (academic achievement). If the researcher does not correctly account for socioeconomic status in the analysis, the results are incorrect. One might for example conclude that the program is effective even if it has no effect.    

In practical application the problem arises that not all confounders are observed or even known and accordingly cannot account for them in our analysis. Thus, we *cannot make claims about causal effects from observational studies*.

### Types of variables
The objects or events of examination (units) are described through *variables*. 

> A variable is a **characteristic** of a unit being observed that may assume **more than one of a set of values** to which a **numerical measure or a category** from a classification can be assigned.

-- OECD, Glossary of statistical terms [üåê](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2857)

In other words, a variable is an *attribute* of a observational unit, which can *vary* from one unit to another. We might, for example, describe people by the variable *handedness*. We can then describe a person's handedness as *right-handed* or *left-handed*. As you can see the definition of variables is broad in general and one can classify them based on their properties.   

The first type of classification is based on *which values a variable can take*. This distinction between *discrete* and *continuous* variables is very important in statistics. We will see many examples of this later in this course when we discuss probability and probability distributions."""

### Scales
According to Steven's (1946) classification there exist 4 scales, which can be assigned to variables. The scale of a variable describes *which mathematical and statistical operations can be applied*. 

| Scale | mathematical operation | statistical operation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *nominal* | determination of (in)equality | (relative) frequency, mode | 
| *ordinal* | determination of greater/less (ranking) | median, percentiles |
| *interval* | determination of equality of intervals or differences | mean, standard deviation, ... |
| *ratio* | determination of equality of ratios | coefficient of variation |
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 31572eb0-f746-11ea-3a11-67414d23ec4d
md"""
#### Nominal scale
The nominal scale is the most unrestricted type of measurement. Accordingly, the fewest mathematical operations of all scales are admissible. When forming a nominal scale we are using numbers as **group labels**. An example of a nominal scale would be the classification of students according to their area of study, e.g. *humanities* (1), *social sciences* (2) *natural sciences* (3), and *other* (4).

Formally we could write this as

$x_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if area of study is humanities,} \\
2 & \text{if area of study is social sciences,} \\
3 & \text{if area of study is natural sciences,} \\
4 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$

The assigned numbers are mere labels, as it makes no reason to state that $x_1 = 1$ is in some way smaller than $x_2 = 2$ or even calculate differences like $x_2 - x_1 = 1$. Instead the only thing we can reasonably ask from a nominal scale is the number of occurances for each category. We call this statistical summary a **frequency** and call the most frequent category the **mode** (see lecture on descriptive statistics for additional information). 

> **Assignment rule:** Do not assign the same number to different classes or different numbers to the same class.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 219fe5be-f746-11ea-3fd6-898d0fb0b316
md"""
#### Ordinal scale
The next step in the hierarchy is the ordinal scale which allows **rank ordering** of the categories. Ordinal scales are the most common type of measurement in the social sciences. A classic example of an ordinal scale is the *grading scheme* in school and university. In Austria we typically construct the following scale, 

$x_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the performance is very good,} \\
2 & \text{if the performance is good,} \\
3 & \text{if the performance is satisfactory,} \\
4 & \text{if the performance is sufficient,} \\
5 & \text{if the performance is insufficient.}
\end{cases}$

If we observe data from 3 people, $x_1 = 4$, $x_2 = 5$, and $x_3 = 3$ it is easy to see that $x_1 < x_2$ and $x_1$ is in some sense better than $x_2$. But when comparing differences like $x_2 - x_1 = 5 - 4 = 1$ and $x_1 - x_3 = 4 - 3 = 1$ we can see that even though the differences are the same numerically, they are very different with regards to performance. For ordinal scales we can calculate statistical measures which are appropriate for rank-ordered data. This includes the **median** or **percentiles**. The cumulative property of scales also allows calculation of statistical summaries appropriate for nominal scales, such as category frequencies. 

> **Assignment rule:** Assign increasing numbers to the classes according to their rank order.

#### Interval scale
The interval scale is the lowest level of a truly *quantitative* scale. This allows for **comparison of intervals and differences**. In contrast to the ratio scale the location of the *zero point is arbitrary*. 

We can see interval scales in temperature measurement. When comparing the *Celsius* and *Fahrenheit* scales it is easy to see that each value corresponds to another value on the other scale.

#### Ratio scale
The ratio scale is an interval scale with the additional property of an **absolute zero**. It is almost never encountered in psychological measurement, but occurs commonly in physical measurement. *Height* or *weight* are common examples of ratio scales. 

The difference between *interval* and *ratio* scales can be seen if we consider two different length measurements *inches* and *centimeters*. If a person has a height of $(h_cm = 176)cm we can calculate their height in inches: $(round(h_cm/2.54)), just like we did with the temperature scales. The difference is the existence of absolute 0 point: a length of 0cm equals 0in. This was not the case for the interval scale (see example above). 

With data on the ratio scale we can compute all statistical measures, including **coefficients of variation**.

We should aspire to satisfy the the principles of psychological testing when constructing our own questionnaire. In order to achieve this we have to ask ourselfes multiple questions.

After brainstorming and literature research one might come to the conclusion that among other reasons students differ in their [academic self concept](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-28099-8_1118-1), i.e. the perception of one's abilities in school. After coming to this conclusion, we can formulate a more concrete research questions or **hypothesis**, which we can test empirically:

As you can see from this example we generally try to explain instead of merely describing something. Oftentimes research questions therefore focus on (causal) relationships between variables. 

A hypothesis typically contains information about

- *The variables of interest* (gender difference in mathematics achievement, gender differences in academic self concept)
- *The relationship between variables* (gender difference in mathematics achievement is caused by differences in academic self concept)
- The conditions under which the relationship holds (Austrian matriculation exam)

To answer our concrete research question it is clear that we need to measure *mathematical achievement* and *academic self-concept*. The process of defining how to measure theoretical constructs of interest is called **operationalization**.   

| construct | operationalization |
| :--- | :--- |
| mathematical achievement | number of items correct in the exam |
| academic self concept | sum score of self concept questionnaire | 

**What is my target audience?**

Definition of the *target population* is a integral part of research design. Depending on the construct of interest, the target population might be obvious such as in the example of *gender differences in the Austrian matriculation exam*.

For a lot of research topics there already exist a variety of material. Especially for research projects which contain constructs that are hard to measure (e.g. personality, leadership skills, ...) it is in many cases advisable to incorporate or use already existing and validated tests. 

If existing material is for whatever reason not appropriate for your application (e.g. different target population, language, ...), it can be useful in practice to adapt the questionnaires for your specific application. 

An example of this is again the research on academic self concept in the context of the Austrian matriculation exam, where we translated and customized existing measures on academic self concept:

### Practical considerations
#### General tips
In practice, the content of a questionnaire is highly dependent on the application. However, some general guidelines can help you purge your questionnaire of unnecessary clutter or increase detail whenever appropriate. Ask yourself these questions:

**Is this question relevant for my research question?**

The necessity of a question is determined by the relevance for the research question. Generally, if you do not need to know some information do not ask for it to keep your questionnaire as short as possible. Even if some information is necessary for your analysis it is sometimes preferrable to *estimate* a quantity instead of asking for it. This is especially true for variables that are prone to **response biases** (see below) such as social desirability. 

> ‚òùÔ∏è Keep your questionnaire streamlined!

**Do I need to ask multiple questions?**

Often a question does not cover all the possibilities we need to know. We encountered such an example already when we discussed the social media usage in the general population. Just asking for television usage is not enough in this case, because the younger generation typically prefers other means of entertainment. 

Psychological tests or scales as we have shown are a systematic approach to investigate a construct of interest. Use already existing ones or exploit their design principles in your own questionnaire design, if the construct is highly relevant to your research question.

#### Wording

**direct vs. indirect questions**

Questions can either *directly* address the construct of interest or be worded such that query is based on indicators of the construct (*indirect*).

> **direct:** Are you anxious?
>
> **indirect:** Do you feel unsafe if you are out on the streets alone at night? 

Direct questions can prove problematic when they require an interpretation of the construct (*anxiety* in the example above). Well chosen (indirect) indicators of the construct can remove this interindividual ambiguity. In certain cases such as *sensitive topics* direct questions can also be uncomfortable or disturbing to answer. This in turn might lead to non-response.

**hypothetical vs. biographical questions**

> **biographical:** How did you behave the last time you had a conflict with a colleague?

Typically biographical questions are considered more reliable, but necessitate situational judgement. Therefore biographical items can only be utilized if you assume every participant already experienced the situation in question. In this respect hypothetical items are more general. In many cases however they are misjudged by the participants, leading to less reliable information.

> **personal:** Do you use condoms?
>
> **unpersonal:** Should one use condoms?

If we want to know about condom usage, the personal variant gives us exactly the infomation we need (provided that participants answer truthfully). In the unpersonal version of the question one could give a *socially desirable* answer (e.g. "Yes, one should"), although they do not use condoms themselves.

A complementary classification system can be based on question content. It should be noted that mixing of the question types described in this section is not recommended as it might lead to **method bias**. Method bias describes a type of measurement error, which arises because of the methods (in this case: different types of questions) in use. In practice one should utilize as few question types as possible, while not compromising questionnaire content. Question content can be based on,

- self-description (*I laugh often.*)
- description of self by others (*Friends consider me a joyous person*)
- biographical facts (*I went on backpacking holidays multiple times*)
- trait descriptions (*I consider myself spontaneous*)
- motivational questions (*I have a preference for challenging tasks*)
- Interests and desires (*I like to watch scientific documentaries*)

- Start your questionnaire with a few easy and non-sensitive questions (*icebreaker questions*)
- Place the difficult and/or sensitive questions near the end of the questionnaire
- Keep topics, scales, and tests clustered together 
- Mark transitions in topics, scales, or tests clearly (e.g. new sections or pages)

## Sampling
We almost never collect data randomly, but are interested in a specific group of people or other groups (e.g. schools). In surveying it is paramount to define this group of people we are interested in exactly. We call it our **target population**.

In the vast majority of cases, we cannot collect data on every *unit* of our population. This is because we usually do not have enough resources (time and/or money) to do so. In many cases it is even theoretically impossible to collect data for every unit of our population. Instead we turn to a statistical process called **sampling**, where we collect data on a *subset of the target population* according to some rule. Using inferential statistics we can then (under some circumstances) *estimate* from the sample the quantity of interest in the population.[^1] 

There are a variety of ways in which to construct a sample. On a basic level we differentiate between **probability sampling** and **nonprobability sampling**. 

In probability sampling, each unit of the target population has some probability greater than 0 to be included in the sample *and* the inclusion probabilities are known for each unit. In other words this means that in theory every unit has a possibility to get sampled and we know how probable it is. While there are many probability sampling schemes, we will take a look at **simple random sampling** and **stratified sampling** in greater detail.

###### Simple random sampling
Simple random sampling is a basic selection process. It is defined as a sampling procedure in which units are chosen completely at random, such that every unit has the exact same probability of being included in the sample. Usually the units are sampled **without replacement**, i.e. each unit can only be included at most once.
When sampling **with replacement** each unit can potentially be included multiple times. 

Imagine we want to figure out what is the percentage of girl births. Our hypothetical population consists of N = 64 births, as you can see below. In the population we observe that $(round(mean(population .== "üë©") * 100))% of births are girls.

In addition to more accurate estimates for the target population we also get estimates at the level of the stratum (age group 1, 2 and 3), because the sampling design *guarantees* a certain amount of cases for each stratum.

Note that in practice *many variables* (and combinations of variables) are used to stratify data! See, for example, [this poll](https://www.unique-research.at/post/umfrage-f%C3%BCr-heute-und-atv-sonntagsfrage-zur-wien-wahl-2020), which incorporates *age*, *education*, *district*, and *sex* as stratification variables.

In constrast, nonprobability sampling refers to sampling processes which allow a probability of zero for some sampling units *or* to sampling processes where the probabilities are unknown. In general this leads to a phenomenon called **sampling bias**, where quantities of the population cannot be estimated correctly. Samples from these processes are called *non-representative* samples, because they do not adequatly reflect the target population. Nonprobability samples are very common, especially in the social sciences. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The results from a nonprobability sample **cannot be generalized** to the target population!

###### Convenience sampling
The convenience sampling method is a common nonprobability sampling method that samples units from the population which are easy to reach. As described above, convenience sampling is not representative of the target population and leads to sampling bias.

Consider again the opinion polling example. Instead of collecting a serious stratified sample of the general population - which takes a lot of effort - we just sample easy to reach people. As we are at university we just ask people in front of the building their political preference. Notice that people at university are younger than the general population and therefore hold a more liberal political opinion (on average).

## Summary
In quantitative research we distinguish between different research methods. Both **controlled experiments** and **natural experiments** are a systematic approach for drawing **causal conclusions** about a phenomenon of interest. **Observational studies**, however, do not allow for causal conclusions, because (unobserved) variables might act as a **confounder** and bias our results.   

Whatever research method used, measurement is a central part of the research design. There are various ways of classifying variables, all used in different contexts. Variables are usually distinguished as **quantitative/qualitative**, **continuous/discrete** or **manifest/latent**. A classification in terms of **scales** (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) allows to associate statistical operations with specific types of variables.

Good item and questionnaire design requires a lot of experience to do well. We have seen the general way of how to arrive at a empirically **testable research questions** and learned how to construct items and questionnaires using different response formats like **dichotomous**, **ordinal** and **continuous response formats**. A general goal was to **keep questionnaires short** and to avoid common pitfalls in the item development process and look out for mistakes regarding **wording**, **comprehension**, **ambiguity** and question **placement**.

We have seen that there are different ways of sampling or how to collect data. While there are approaches like **convenience sampling** which seem tempting at first, one has to be aware that results of these **non-probability sampling** procedures do not allow the researcher to make (statistical) statements about the target population. If at all feasible **probability sampling** schemes are to be preferred. Even though data collection using **simple random sampling**, **stratified sampling** or other sampling methods can be a lot more complex, the additional effort is in many cases worth it, because inferences about the target population can be drawn.

###### Stratified sampling
Stratified sampling can be employed when an overall population can be *exhaustively partitioned* into subpopulations. This partitioning requires additional knowledge about the population, because we need to know the partitioning variables of each unit in the population. We can, for example, partition a population by *age* by assigning people to age groups `<= 39`, `40 - 59`, and `>= 60` years. Note that this classification must be **exhaustive**, i.e. each unit in the population is classified, and **exclusive**: each unit is assigned to one group only. The process of partitioning is called **stratification**. The resulting subpopulation groups are **strata**. After stratification we sample units by *simple random sampling in each stratum*. The sample sizes in each stratum are proportional to the respective size of the subpopulation.  

A classic example of stratified sampling are political opinion polls. For the following example, assume that people get more conservative with increasing age and in turn vote for more conservative political parties. In this case we might want to *stratify by age* to get an accurate picture of how the upcoming election will turn out. We define 3 strata in a population of N = 100 people, 

| stratum (age group) | stratum index | population size |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  <= 39 | 1 | 32 |
| 40 - 59 | 2 | 47 |
|  >= 60 | 3 | 21 |

In the population we observe the following distribution of preferred parties.[^2]

One of the most well known examples of a natural experiment is the 1854 Cholera outbreak in London. 

At the time there were two competing theories about the causes of the disease. The *Miasma theory* argued for a transmission via "bad air", whereas the *germ theory* considered transmission of diseases via "germs" (microorganisms in todays language).

### Tests

> Any **standardized instrument**, including scales and self-report inventories, used to measure behavior or mental attributes, such as attitudes, emotional functioning, intelligence and cognitive abilities (reasoning, comprehension, abstraction, etc.), aptitudes, values, interests, and personality characteristics. [...]

-- *APA Dictionary of Psychology* [üåê](https://dictionary.apa.org/psychological-test)

- Psychological tests meet specific **scientific standards**
- Tests are constructed of multiple **stimuli** (e.g. questions or tasks). Participants *react* to these stimuli and in turn get assigned numerical values corresponding to their reaction. 
- Based on these assignments one strives to *infer the magnitude behaviour or mental attribute* in question (construct). 

In general, psychological constructs are not observable directly (they are **latent**), but manifest in specific behaviours. Psychological tests are used to assess the magnitude of said psychological construct by using observable (**manifest**) behaviours as *idicators of the construct*,

$(Resource("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Congeneric_measurement_model.png", :width => 500))

Psychological tests use multiple indicators to increase the coverage of the construct as well as the accuracy of the results. Tests vary dramatically by their number of indicators as we can see in the following example, 

| Test | number of indicators | required time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Handedness Inventory (student questionnaire) | 10 | 1-2 minutes |
| NEO-PI-R (personality questionnaire) | 240 | 30-40 minutes |

**sample indicators:** (Big Five - Extraversion)
$(center(md"*I start conversations.*"))
$(center(md"*I think a lot before I speak or act.*"))
$(center(md"*I don't mind being the center of attention.*"))

As you can see, different indicators refer to different behaviours. The sum of behaviour tendencies then leads to some score on the latent extraversion construct. With these scores we can apply statistical analysis to compare people or groups of people.
