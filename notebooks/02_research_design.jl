### Measurement in the social sciences

>  measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the **assignment of numerals to objects or events** according to rules.

-- Stevens, S. S. (1946). On the Theory of Scales of Measurements. *Science*. [üì©](https://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/jgrice/psyc3214/Stevens_FourScales_1946.pdf)

- Very broad definition of measurement, which is not necessarily compatible with measurement in a physical sense.
- Allows a classification of *scales* with associated mathematical and statistical operations.

### Scales
According to Steven's (1946) classification there exist 4 scales: 

| Scale | mathematical operation | statistical operation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *nominal* | determination of (in)equality | (relative) frequency, mode | 
| *ordinal* | determination of greater/less (ranking) | median, percentiles |
| *interval* | determination of equality of intervals or differences | mean, standard deviation, ... |
| *ratio* | determination of equality of ratios | coefficient of variation |

- Scales are **cumulative**, meaning that a scale must satisfy all properties of *lower* scales.

#### Nominal scale
- Most unrestricted type of measurement
- Fewest mathematical operations admissible

When forming a nominal scale we are using numbers as **group labels**. An example of a nominal scale would be the classification of students according to their area of study, e.g. *humanities* (1), *social sciences* (2) *natural sciences* (3), and *other* (4).

Formally we could write this as

$x_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if area of study is humanities,} \\
2 & \text{if area of study is social sciences,} \\
3 & \text{if area of study is natural sciences,} \\
4 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$

The assigned numbers are mere labels, as it makes no reason to state that $x_1 = 1$ is in some way smaller than $x_2 = 2$ or even calculate differences like $x_2 - x_1 = 1$. Instead the only thing we can reasonably ask from a nominal scale is the number of occurances for each category. We call this statistical summary a **frequency** and call the most frequent category the **mode** (see lecture on descriptive statistics for additional information). 

> **Assignment rule:** Do not assign the same number to different classes or different numbers to the same class.

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 219fe5be-f746-11ea-3fd6-898d0fb0b316
md"""
#### Ordinal scale
The next step in the hierarchy is the *ordinal scale* which allows **rank ordering** of the categories.

- most common type of measurement in the social sciences

A classic example of an ordinal scale is the *grading scheme* in school and university. In Austria we construct the following scale, 

$x_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the performance is very good,} \\
2 & \text{if the performance is good,} \\
3 & \text{if the performance is satisfactory,} \\
4 & \text{if the performance is sufficient,} \\
5 & \text{if the performance is insufficient.}
\end{cases}$

If we observe data from 2 people, $x_1 = 4$ and $x_2 = 5$ it is easy to see that $x_1 < x_2$ and $x_1$ is in some sense better than $x_2$. While we can calculate differences in ranks, - a property that is reserved for interval and ratio scales.

> **Assignment rule:** Assign increasing numbers to the classes according to their rank order.

## Sampling
We almost never collect data randomly, but are interested in a specific group of people or other groups (e.g. schools). In surveying it is paramount to define this group of people we are interested in exactly. We call it our **target population**.

In the vast majority of cases, we cannot collect data on every *unit* of our population. This is because we usually do not have enough resources (time and/or money) to do so. In many cases it is even theoretically impossible to collect data for every unit of our population. Instead we turn to a statistical process called **sampling**, where we collect data on a *subset of the target population* according to some rule. Using inferential statistics we can then (under some circumstances) *estimate* from the sample the quantity of interest in the population.[^1] 

There are a variety of ways in which to construct a sample. On a basic level we differentiate between **probability sampling** and **nonprobability sampling**. 

In probability sampling, each unit of the target population has some probability greater than 0 to be included in the sample *and* the inclusion probabilities are known for each unit. In other words this means that in theory every unit has a possibility to get sampled and we know how probable it is. Probability sampling schemes include

###### Simple random sampling
Simple random sampling is a basic selection process. It is defined as a sampling procedure in which units are chosen completely at random, such that every unit has the exact same probability of being included in the sample. Usually the units are sampled **without replacement**, i.e. each unit can only be included at most once.
When sampling **with replacement** each unit can potentially be included multiple times. 

Imagine we want to figure out what is the percentage of girl births. Our hypothetical population consists of N = 64 births, as you can see below. In the population we observe that $(round(mean(population .== "üë©") * 100))% of births are girls.
"""

md"""
In practice we do not observe the whole population, but we can draw a random sample by selecting each individual birth with probability $\frac{n}{N}$ and estimate the percentage of girl births.

In constrast, nonprobability sampling refers to sampling processes which allow a probability of zero for some sampling units *or* to sampling processes where the probabilities are unknown. In general this leads to a phenomenon called **sampling bias**, where quantities of the population cannot be estimated correctly. Samples from these processes are called *non-representative* samples, because they do not adequatly reflect the target population. Nonprobability samples are very common, especially in the social sciences. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The results from a nonprobability sample **cannot be generalized** to the target population!
